# Chapter 5: Strings

A string is a sequence of one or more characters, and one of the most frequently used types in programming. It is therefore fitting that we acquaint ourselves with the idea of operating on strings.

## String and character literals

You might be familiar by now with string and character literals from the introductory chapter, which introduced some literals, or from other programming languages. A string literal is surrounded by _double quotes_: `" string "`. Within the string, you can escape a double-quote using a backslash:

```julia
	"This string contains a \" double quote \" "

```

Strings are _immutable_ and _indexable_ – indices return the characters at the index position, starting from 1.

### The difference between string and character literals

String and character literals are differentiated by two indicia:

- strings may have a length other than one while a `Char` type object necessarily has the length one (or potentially zero),
- strings are introduced and terminated by double quotation marks `""`, `Char` type objects are introduced by single apostrophes `''`.

The second of these tends to be somewhat vexing for many programmers who are used to the equivalence of `''` and `""` in languages that do not necessarily have an implemented type or class for characters mirroring `Char`. So while for instance in Python, `'a' == "a"` holds, this is not the case in Julia:

```julia
	julia> typeof("a")
	String (constructor with 2 methods)

	julia> typeof('a')
	Char

	julia> "a" == 'a'
	false

```

### Heredocs and multiline literals

Multiline literals allow you to keep longer spans of text within a single string, with line breaks. They are introduced, similarly to Python, by triple double quotation marks `"""`:

```julia
	multiline_declaration = """
		We hold these truths to be self-evident,
		that all men are created equal,
		that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
		that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

		That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
		deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...
	"""

	julia> println(multiline_declaration)
		We hold these truths to be self-evident,
		that all men are created equal,
		that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
		that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

		That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
		deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...

```

As you can see, the use of the `"""` or 'heredoc' format has preserved the line breaks and structure of the text, a rather helpful feature where longer texts are concerned.

## Regex literals

Regular expressions (regexes) are special strings that represent particular patterns. They are useful in matching and searching text, and a good knowledge of regex should be essential knowledge for any good functional programmer.

To construct a regex literal, preface the string with `r`:

```julia
	julia> regex_literal = r"a|e|i|o|u"
	r"a|e|i|o|u"

```

This is a regex literal that matches (English) vowels. Julia recognises regex literals as the type `regex`:

```julia
	julia> typeof(regex_literal)
	Regex

```

## String operations

### Substrings

Because strings are indexable, we can use _ranges_ to select a part of a string, something we generally refer to as a _substring_ or _string subsetting_:

```julia
	julia> declaration = "When in the Course of human events"
	"When in the Course of human events"

	julia> declaration[1:4]
	"When"

```

You might recall that a range might actually have a `step` attribute, which we can use to obtain every _n\_th_ letter within a text. Let's see every odd-numbered letter within the first few words of the Declaration of Independence:

```julia
	julia> declaration[1:2:end]
	"We nteCus fhmneet"

```

You might remember that `end`, which we used above to extend the range across the entire length of the string, behaves like a number. Therefore, you can use it to create a substring that excludes the last, say, five letters:

```julia
	 julia> declaration[1:end-5]
	 "When in the Course of human e"

```

### Concatenation, splitting and interpolation

#### Concatenating and repeating

In most programming languages, maths and string operations correspond, so you can use `+` to concatenate and `*` to repeat a string. This is _not_ the case in Julia. `+` has no method for `String`s. What you would expect `+` to do is accomplished by `*`:

```julia
	julia> "I" * " <3 " * "Julia"
	"I <3 Julia"

```

So how do you multiply a sequence of text? Easy – use the `^` operator. This is useful if you happen to have been set the old school punishment of 'lines' (writing the same sentence all over again).

```julia
	julia> "I will not say bad things about functional languages again. " ^ 10
	"I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. I will not say bad things about functional languages again. "

```

#### `split()`

The `split()` function separates a piece of text at a particular character, which it also removes. The result is an array of the chunks. By default, split() will separate at spaces, but you can provide any other string – not even necessarily a single character, as the third example shows:

```julia
	julia> split(declaration)
	7-element Array{SubString{String},1}:
	 "When"
	 "in"
	 "the"
	 "Course"
	 "of"
	 "human"
	 "events"

	julia> split(declaration, "e")
	6-element Array{SubString{String},1}:
	 "Wh"
	 "n in th"
	 " Cours"
	 " of human "
	 "v"
	 "nts"

	julia> split(declaration, "the")
	2-element Array{SubString{String},1}:
	 "When in "
	 " Course of human events"

```

If you provide `""` as the string to split at, Julia will split the text into individual letters.

You may also use a regex to split your text at:

```julia
	julia> regex_literal = r"a|e|i|o|u"
	julia> split(declaration, regex_literal)
	12-element Array{SubString{String},1}:
	 "Wh"
	 "n "
	 "n th"
	 " C"
	 ""
	 "rs"
	 " "
	 "f h"
	 "m"
	 "n "
	 "v"
	 "nts"

```

Needless to say, since strings are immutable, the original string is not affected by the application of `split()`.

#### Interpolation

String interpolation refers to the incredibly useful capability of including variable values within a string. As you might remember, we have used `*` above to concatenate strings:

```julia
	julia> love = "<3"
	"<3"

	julia> "I " * love * " Julia"
	"I <3 Julia"

```

While this is technically correct, it is much faster by using string interpolation, in which case we would refer back to the variable `love` as `$(love)` within the string. Julia knows this means it is to replace `$(love)` with the contents of the variable `love`:

```julia
	julia> "I $(love) Julia"
	"I <3 Julia"

```

You can put anything within the parentheses in string interpolation – anything Julia knows how to handle. For instance, including an expression in a string, you get

```julia
	julia> "Three plus four is $(3+4)."
	"Three plus four is 7."

```

If, and only if, you are referring to a variable, you can omit the parentheses (but not if you are referring to an expression):

```julia
	julia> "I $love Julia"
	"I <3 Julia"

```

## Regular expressions and finding text within strings

As it has been mentioned, the main utility of regular expressions (Regexes) is to find things within long pieces of text. In the following, we will introduce the three main regex search functions of Julia - `match()`, `matchall()` and `eachmatch()`, with reference to a bit of the Declaration of Independence:

```julia
	declaration = "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."

```

If you are familiar with regular expressions, plod ahead! However, if

```julia
	(GIR 0AA)|((([A-Z-[QVX]][0-9][0-9]?)|(([A-Z-[QVX]][A-Z-[IJZ]][0-9][0-9]?)|(([A-Z-[QVX]][0-9][A-HJKSTUW])|([A-Z-[QVX]][A-Z-[IJZ]][0-9][ABEHMNPRVWXY])))) [0-9][A-Z-[CIKMOV]]{2})

```

looks like gobbledygook to you or you feel your regex fu is a little rusty, put down this book and consult the [Regex cheatsheet](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html#ref) or, even better, [Jeffrey Friedl's amazing book on mastering regexes](http://regex.info/book.html).

### Finding Substring

If you are only concerned with finding a single instance of a search term within a string, the `findfirst()` function returns the range index of where the search expression appears:

```julia
	julia> findfirst("Government",declaration)
	241:250

```

`findfirst()` also accepts regular expressions:

```julia
	julia> findfirst(r"th.{2,3}", declaration)
	9:13

```

To retrieve the result, rather than its index, you can pass the resulting index off to the string as the subsetting range, using the square bracket `[]` syntax:

```julia
	julia> declaration[findfirst(r"th.{2,3}", declaration)]
	"these"

```

Ah, so that's the word it found!

Where a search string is not found, `findfirst()` will yield `nothing`.

### Finding using the `match()` family of functions

The problem with `findfirst()` is that it retrieves one, and only one, result – the first within the string passed to it. The `match()` family of functions can help us with finding more results:

- `match()` retrieves _either the first match or nothing_ within the text,
- `matchall()` returns _an array of all matching substrings_, and
- `eachmatch()` returns an _iterator over all matches_.

The `match()` family of functions needs a regular expression literal as a search argument. This is so even if the regular expression does not make use of any pattern matching beyond a simple string. Thus,

```julia
	julia> match(r"truths", declaration)

```

is valid, while

```julia
	julia> match("truths", declaration)

```

yields an error:

```julia
	ERROR: MethodError: no method matching match(::String, ::String)

```

#### Understanding `RegexMatch` objects

Most regex search functions return an object of type `RegexMatch`. As the name reveals, a `RegexMatch` is a composite type representing a match. As such, it encapsulates (to use a little more OOP terminology than one would normally be allowed to in a book on functional programming) four values, the first three of which will be of immediate interest to us:

- `RegexMatch.match` is the matched substring,
- `RegexMatch.captures` is an array of types that represent the type of what the regex would capture,
- `RegexMatch.offset` is generally an `Int64` that represents the index of the first character of the matched string where there is a single match (e.g. when using `match()`).

To illustrate, let's consider the result of a `match()` call, which will be introduced in the next subsection:

```julia
	m = match(r"That .*?,", declaration)

	julia> m.match
	"That to secure these rights,"

	julia> m.captures
	0-element Array{Union(SubString{UTF8String},Nothing),1}

	julia> m.offset
	212

```

#### `match()`

`match()` retrieves the first match or nothing - in this sense, it is rather similar to `findfirst()`:

```julia
	julia> match(r"That .*?,", declaration)
	RegexMatch("That to secure these rights,")

```

The result is a `RegexMatch` object. The object can be inspected using `.match` (e.g. `match(r"truths", declaration).match`).

#### `eachmatch()`

`eachmatch()` returns an object known as an iterator, specifically of the type `RegexMatchIterator`. We have on and off encountered iterators, but we will not really deal with them in depth until chapter [X], which deals with control flow. Suffice it to say an iterator is an object that contains a list of items that can be iterated through. The iterator will iterate over a list of `RegexMatch` objects, so if we want the results themselves, we will need to call the `.match` method on each of them:

```julia
	for i in eachmatch(r"That .*?,", declaration)
		println("A matching search result is: $(i.match)")
	end

```
gives following result:

```julia
	A matching search result is: That to secure these rights,
	A matching search result is: That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,

```

#### `occursin()`

`occursin()` returns a boolean value depending on whether the search text contains a match for the regex provided.

```julia
	julia> occursin(r"truth(s)?", declaration)
	true

	julia> occursin(r"sausage(s)?", declaration)
	false

```

### Replacing substrings

Julia can replace substrings using the `replace()` syntax... let's try putting some sausages into the Declaration of Independence!

```julia
	julia> replace(declaration, "truth"=>"sausage",count=1)
	"We hold these sausages to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,..."

```
By increasing the value of count you can replace remaining "truth".

Much more dignified than self-evident sausages, I'd say! At risk of repeating myself, it is important to note that since strings are immutable, `replace()` merely returns a copy of the string with the search string replaced by the replacement string or the result of the replacement function, and the original string itself will remain unaffected.

Where the substring is not found, the result will be, unsurprisingly, an unaltered string.

### Regex flags

A little-known feature of Julia regexes is the ability for a regex to be appended one or more flags. These, like most of Julia's regex capability, derive from Perl's regex module `perlre`.

| Flag |Function |
|:----:|---------|
| i    | Case-insensitive pattern matching|
| m    | Treats string as a multiline string, so that `^` and `$` will refer to the start or end of any line within the string. |
| s    | Treats line as a single line. This will result in `.` accepting a newline as well. When used together with `m`, it will result in `.` matching every possible character while still allowing `^` and `$` to match, just after and just before newlines within the string. |
| x   | Ignore non-backslashed, non-classed whitespace. |

Flags are appended to the end of each regex, which might strike users more familiar with e.g. the Pythonic way of modifying the regex search object itself, as somewhat unusual:

```julia
	multiline = r"^We"m

```

In this case, the regex `r"^We"` was augmented by the multiline flag, appended at its end.

## String transformation and testing

### Case transformations

Case transformations are functions that act on `String`s and transform character case. Let's examine the effect of these transformations in turn.

| Function | Effect | Result |
|:--------:|--------|--------|
| `uppercase()` | Converts the entire string to upper-case characters | `WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT` |
| `lowercase()` | Converts the entire string to lower-case characters | `we hold these truths to be self-evident` |
| `uppercasefirst()` | Converts the first character of the string to upper-case | `We hold these truths to be self-evident` |
| `lowercasefirst()` | Converts the first character of the string to lower-case | `we hold these truths to be self-evident` |
